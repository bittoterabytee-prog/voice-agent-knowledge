# Project Rules

Rules for humans and AI agents working on the **AI Voice Agent Frontend** repository.

1. **Backend is the source of truth for appointment availability, call records, and conversation state.** The UI must display API data — never invent slots, bookings, or call outcomes.
2. **AI must never invent appointment availability** in UI copy, mocks shipped as “live”, or client-side logic that pretends slots exist without a backend response.
3. **AI must never claim an appointment was booked** in the UI unless a booking API confirms success.
4. **Do not implement voice STT/TTS or conversation state machines in this repo** unless a ticket explicitly moves that ownership here. Prefer the backend `voice-agent` repository. **Exceptions:** (KAN-10) browser microphone permission, MediaStream capture, level metering, and PCM chunk handoff; (KAN-16 / KAN-17) MediaRecorder → base64 clips, `POST /api/voice/turn` / session HTTP wiring, TTS playback of backend `audioBase64`, and Sprint 2 E2E recovery (Resume / multi-turn). See [`docs/voice/AUDIO_CAPTURE.md`](docs/voice/AUDIO_CAPTURE.md), [`docs/architecture/VOICE_PIPELINE.md`](docs/architecture/VOICE_PIPELINE.md), and [`docs/testing/E2E_SPRINT2_KAN17.md`](docs/testing/E2E_SPRINT2_KAN17.md).
5. **Medical diagnosis is outside the scope of the product.** Dashboard copy and future agent surfaces must not provide diagnosis.
6. **Never expose API keys or secrets.** Do not commit `.env`, PATs, or credentials. Vite may only expose public `VITE_*` values.
7. **Do not put secrets in documentation or MCP prompts.** Use placeholders such as `YOUR_GITHUB_PAT`.
8. **External HTTP access must go through `src/services/`** (e.g. `apiClient.ts`). Do not scatter raw `fetch` calls with hard-coded base URLs across components.
9. **Configuration is env-driven.** Backend URL comes from `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (see `.env.example`). Do not require source edits to point at another API host.
10. **Tests are mandatory for product changes.** Before coding, review related cases under `tests/`. Add or update tests for every feature, fix, or regression. Run `npm test` before finishing. Docs/rules-only edits may skip product tests. See [`docs/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](docs/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) and [`.cursor/rules/tests-and-knowledge.mdc`](.cursor/rules/tests-and-knowledge.mdc).
11. **Preserve the dashboard shell structure** (layout, nav, panels) when adding features; prefer extending pages/services over one-off pages outside routing.
12. **Keep knowledge in sync with every change.** Update matching docs in the same change set: `docs/**`, root `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `SYSTEM_FLOW.md` / `PROJECT_RULES.md`, and Cursor rules under `.cursor/rules/` when workflow changes. Do not leave docs stale after behavior or structure shifts.
13. **MCP GitHub access is read-only by default.** Do not enable write toolsets unless explicitly approved.
14. **Handle backend unavailability gracefully.** System Status and future data views must show error/loading states — never crash the shell.
15. **Jira, branch, and PR workflow (required for all ticket work):**
    - Before starting work, **ask for the Jira ticket number** if it is not already provided; if it is known, use it.
    - Create a branch from `main` with one of: `feat/{title}`, `fix/{title}`, or `bugfix/{title}`.
    - Preferred full form: `{prefix}/{JIRA-KEY}-{short-kebab-title}` (e.g. `feat/KAN-9-project-knowledge-docs`, `fix/KAN-12-status-error-state`, `bugfix/KAN-15-history-crash`).
    - When pushing ticket work, push the feature branch and **open a pull request** (do not land ticket work by pushing straight to `main`).
    - PR title should include the ticket key.
    - **Every PR body must include:** (1) a **high-level diagram** (Mermaid preferred), (2) a **description** of what/why with Jira link, and (3) **test cases** (ticket TCs + verification checklist). See [`.cursor/rules/git-jira-pr-workflow.mdc`](.cursor/rules/git-jira-pr-workflow.mdc) and [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md).
