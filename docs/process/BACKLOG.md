**E2E runbook (KAN-17):** [`../testing/E2E_BROWSER_VOICE.md`](../testing/E2E_BROWSER_VOICE.md).

**Epic (Sprint 2 container):** Create Epic **Sprint 2 — Basic Voice Agent** in Jira and set Parent on KAN-10–KAN-18 / KAN-21 (label `sprint-2`). Until then, treat those keys as the active sprint To Do set per this doc.

**Dependency order:** **KAN-10 → KAN-11/12/13 → KAN-15 → KAN-14 → KAN-16 → KAN-17**, with **KAN-18** in parallel once the pipeline exists.

Each ticket includes: **Purpose/Description**, **High-Level Flow**, **Test Cases**, **Acceptance Criteria** (plus Scope / Dependencies / Definition of Done).

**Jira board action:** keep KAN-10–KAN-18 on the **active Sprint 2** board as To Do / In Progress (KAN-10–KAN-12 Done). Do not pull Sprint 3–8 themes into Sprint 2.
