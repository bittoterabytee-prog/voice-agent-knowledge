# Jira Ticket Writing Standards

When creating or updating work items for the AI Voice Agent (backend or frontend), every ticket **must** include the four sections below. Incomplete tickets should be rejected in review.

## Required sections

### 1. High-Level Flow

A short ASCII or mermaid-style flow showing the main path (user/system steps). Keep it to the happy path plus one critical branch if needed.

### 2. Description / Purpose

- What problem this solves
- Scope (in / out)
- Owner layer: `Frontend` | `Backend` | `Backend/AI` | `Full Stack`
- Dependencies on other tickets or systems
- Links to relevant docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SYSTEM_FLOW.md`, `docs/...`)

### 3. Test Cases

Numbered Given / When / Then cases (TC-001…). Cover:

- Happy path
- Missing/invalid input
- Failure of external dependency (STT/LLM/TTS/network)
- Security / no secret leakage where relevant

### 4. Acceptance Criteria

Checklist of observable outcomes. Prefer measurable “done” statements over vague intent.

## Optional but recommended

- Definition of Done (1 short paragraph)
- Labels: `frontend`, `backend`, `ai`, `voice`, `fullstack`
- Link related tickets (blocked-by / relates-to)

## Rules for agents creating tickets

1. Do **not** create bare titles without the four sections.
2. Match flows to the real architecture (browser mic POC; no telephony unless explicitly requested).
3. Backend tickets reference `src/` paths; frontend tickets belong to the **separate frontend repo** but may still be tracked on the same Jira board.
4. **Backend product scope** comes from [`docs/backend/SRD_BACKEND.md`](../backend/SRD_BACKEND.md) (appointment tools, state, RAG, safety, error handling). Derive ticket Description / Test Cases / Acceptance Criteria from the matching SRD sections; link that doc in the ticket. When updating an existing backend ticket, re-check it against the SRD so scope does not drift.
5. **Sprint placement** comes from [`SPRINT_PLAN.md`](SPRINT_PLAN.md). New tickets go into the **current sprint** (today: Sprint 2 — Basic Voice Agent) unless the user names a later sprint. Do not mix Sprint 4+ appointment/RAG themes into Sprint 2. Update [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) after creating tickets.
6. After creating tickets, add key IDs to [`docs/process/BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) and mention them in `ARCHITECTURE.md` when they become active work.
7. Prefer Story work type unless the board standard says otherwise.
8. Implementation follows [`BRANCH_AND_PR.md`](BRANCH_AND_PR.md): confirm ticket key → named branch → PR on push.
9. Implementers must **check ticket test cases**, **add/update automated tests**, and **update knowledge docs** for the change ([`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`](../testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md)).
